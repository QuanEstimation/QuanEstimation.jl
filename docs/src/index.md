# QuanEstimation.jl

QuanEstimation.jl is an open-source Julia framework for scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation. 
It can be used either as an independent package or as the computational core of the recently developed Python-Julia 
package QuanEstimation [Github](https://github.com/QuanEstimation/QuanEstimation). Utilizing this framework, the 
scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation can be readily performed, especially when quantum noises 
exist.
